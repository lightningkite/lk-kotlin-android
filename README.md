Lightning Kite's project to make Android even more awesome for speedy development

## What is this?

This project contains a number of small, minimalist libraries for improving and speeding up Android development.

All of them use a combination of Android and Kotlin, and possibly other languages.

Each piece of the library is built to be read - in other words, you should be able to look at the source of anything in it and understand it pretty much immediately.  If not, please make a GitHub issue for it so that it can be better written or at least better documented.

This includes the following packages:

[mighty-view](mighty-view/README.md) - My favorite package, personally.  While it, of itself, contains only four extension functions, it represents an entirely new, clean way of making Android apps.  It has dependencies on several other packages in this library.
[activity-access](activity-access/README.md) -
[animations](animations/README.md) -
[animations-observable](animations-observable/README.md) -
[design-extensions](design-extensions/README.md) -
[dialogs](dialogs/README.md) -
[extensions](extensions/README.md) -
[image-loading](image-loading/README.md) -
[image-loading-observable](image-loading-observable/README.md) -
[lifecycle](lifecycle/README.md) -
[observable](observable/README.md) -
[observable-validation](observable-validation/README.md) -
[ui-thread](ui-thread/README.md) -
[anko-adapters-observable](anko-adapters-observable/README.md) -
[anko-adapters](anko-adapters/README.md) -
[anko-animations-observable](anko-animations-observable/README.md) -
[anko-animations](anko-animations/README.md) -
[anko-extensions](anko-extensions/README.md) -
